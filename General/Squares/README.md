# Squares

## Part 1
Create a program that given a length will output a square of that length. 

## Examples

Given a length of 4, your program should output the following:

```
xxxx
x  x
x  x
x  x
xxxx
```

Given a length of 6, your program should output the following:

```
xxxxxx
x    x
x    x
x    x
xxxxxx
```

## Part 2
Extend your program to output two squares, one on top of the other. 

## Example

Given two lengths 3 and 6, your program should output the following:

```
xxxxxx
x x  x
xxx  x
x    x
xxxxxx
```
